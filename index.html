        <p>The Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R (1999 - 2002). Fifth and last of the Skyline GT-Rs (the R35 dropped the â€˜Skylineâ€™ part of the name), poster-child for a generation weaned on the likes of Gran Turismo, Fast & Furious and a host of other digital dreams. An angry-looking four-seat coupe so full of Japanese technical brilliance that back in the day it could carve out a laptime that belied its apparent lack of power.</p>

            A lack addressed post-haste by a myriad of tuners who  - primed by the â€™32 and â€™33 - knew that the basic GT-R package was fertile soil for boost and trickery. And over the years, as with every generation of GT-R, there have been some monster meddled-with specials - 400bhp with a vague re-map, 5-600 with some relatively minor internals, 800 -1000bhp if you go the whole hog and start forging things and walloping about with monster single blowers.

            Plenty of interesting acronyms, including Super-HICAS four-wheel steer, ATTESA E-TS (Advanced Total Traction Engineering System for All-Terrain) four-wheel drive and a limited-slip diff at either end, the rearmost being active on the V-Spec cars. Itâ€™s a six-speed manual, now relatively small compared to modern gear, full of attitude.

            The basic car is still an impressive bit of kit, mind. The legendary 2.6-litre RB26DETT straight-six twin-turbo motor (2.8 in some variants) apparently put out a â€˜gentlemanâ€™s agreementâ€™ 276bhp from the factory - though they rarely did in reality. Most were tested in the 330bhp range, though no one ever admitted anything officially, so maybe the horses were simply breeding on the ship from Japan.
